Then, for each number in the array, we check if its complement (i.e., the difference between the target and the current number) is already in the map. If it is, we return the index of the complement and the index of the current number plus one.\n\nNote that this solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the `nums` array."

It consists of a series of keys arranged in a specific layout, which allow users to enter text, commands, and other information into the device.\n\nTypical features of a keyboard include:\n\n1. Keys: The primary components of a keyboard are the individual keys that can be pressed to input data.\n2. Layout: Keyboards come in various layouts, such as QWERTY (the most common layout), QWERTZ (used in some European countries), and Dvorak (a more ergonomic design).\n3. Keystrokes: When a key is pressed, it triggers a keystroke, which sends an electrical signal to the device.\n4. Input mechanism: The keys are connected to switches or sensors that detect when they are pressed.\n\nKeyboards can be categorized into several types:\n\n1. Mechanical keyboards: These use individual mechanical switches under each key, providing tactile feedback and a distinct sound when pressed.\n2. Membrane keyboards: These use a single layer of conductive material underneath the keys, which detects keystrokes when pressed.\n3. Virtual keyboards: These are projected onto a surface using technology such as capacitive or resistive touch screens.\n\nKeyboards serve various purposes:\n\n1. Input device: Keyboards allow users to enter text, commands, and other information into the device.\n2. Navigation: Keyboards provide navigation options for scrolling, selecting, and interacting with digital content.\n3. Communication: Keyboards enable communication through email, messaging apps, and social media.\n\nIn summary, a keyboard is an essential input device that allows users to interact with electronic devices, entering data and navigating digital interfaces with ease."

It is essentially the screen on which you view your content.\n\nMonitors can be categorized into several types:\n\n1. CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) monitors: These use an old technology that uses a phosphorescent coating to create images.\n2. LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) monitors: These use liquid crystals to block or allow light to pass through a matrix of pixels, creating images.\n3. LED (Light Emitting Diode) monitors: These are similar to LCD monitors but use LEDs instead of CCFLs (Cold-Cathode Fluorescent Lamps) for backlighting.\n4. OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode) monitors: These use an emissive technology, where each pixel emits its own light, creating true blacks and a wider color gamut.\n\nKey features of a monitor include:\n\n1. Resolution: The number of pixels that make up the image on the screen.\n2. Size: The physical size of the monitor.\n3. Aspect ratio: The shape of the screen, which can be 16:9 (widescreen), 4:3 (square), or other ratios.\n4. Refresh rate: How often the monitor updates the image to prevent flicker and provide smooth motion.\n5. Response time: How quickly the monitor can change the color of a pixel.\n\nMonitors serve several purposes:\n\n1. Displaying content: Monitors show images, videos, and text from electronic devices.\n2. Gaming: Monitors are used for gaming, providing an immersive experience with high-resolution graphics and fast response times.\n3. Productivity: Monitors enable users to work on documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.\n4.

    "content": "Congratulations on creating a Telegram bot in Go!\n\nDeploying a Telegram bot on production requires some planning and setup. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:\n\n**Prerequisites**\n\n1. Make sure your bot is working correctly and responding to commands.\n2. Create a Telegram API token for your bot (you can do this by going to the BotFather bot in Telegram).\n3. Familiarize yourself with the Go ecosystem, especially the `net/http` package.\n\n**Step 1: Choose a deployment method**\n\nYou have several options to deploy your Telegram bot on production:\n\n1. **Containerization**: Use Docker to containerize your bot and run it on a cloud platform like AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP).\n2. **Serverless**: Deploy your bot using a serverless platform like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, or Azure Functions.\n3. **Cloud provider**: Deploy your bot directly to a cloud provider like AWS EC2, GCP Compute Engine, or Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines.\n\n**Step 2: Set up a server**\n\nChoose an operating system (e.g., Ubuntu) and set up a server with the necessary dependencies installed:\n\n* Go (version 1.17 or later)\n* Gorilla's `gorilla/mux` package for routing\n* The `net/http` package for handling incoming requests\n\nYou can use a cloud provider's managed instance or create your own server.\n\n**Step 3: Create a RESTful API**\n\nCreate a RESTful API that receives incoming requests from Telegram and responds accordingly. You'll need to:\n\n1. Handle incoming requests using the `net/http` package.\n2. Parse the request body (if any) using Go's built-in `encoding/json` package.\n3. Use the Telegram API token to authenticate incoming requests.\n\n**Step 4: Deploy your bot**\n\nDeploy your bot on your chosen server and set up a load balancer (e.g., NGINX, HAProxy) to distribute traffic evenly.\n\n**Step 5: Configure Telegram Bot API settings**\n\nConfigure the Telegram Bot API settings:\n\n1. Set the `api_id` and `api_hash` variables in your code.\n2. Use the `SetWebhook` method to set up a webhook for incoming requests.\n\nHere's some sample Go code to get you started:\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"encoding/json\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"io/ioutil\"\n\t\"log\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n\n\t\"github.com/gorilla/mux\"\n)\n\ntype TelegramRequest struct {\n\t// Your request body here\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tr := mux.NewRouter()\n\tr.HandleFunc(\"/webhook\", webhookHandler)\n\tlog.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(\":8080\", r))\n}\n\nfunc webhookHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n\tvar telegramRequest TelegramRequest\n\terr := json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(\u0026telegramRequest)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\thttp.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusBadRequest)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\tlog.Println(telegramRequest)\n\tw.Write([]byte(\"Hello from your bot!\"))\n}\n```\nThis is just a basic example to get you started. You'll need to add more functionality and error handling to make your bot production-ready.\n\n**Additional resources**\n\n* Telegram Bot API documentation: \u003chttps://core.telegram.org/bots/api\u003e\n* Go documentation: \u003chttps://golang.org/doc/\u003e\n* Gorilla's `gorilla/mux` package documentation: \u003chttps://github.com/gorilla/mux\u003e\n\nI hope this helps you deploy your Telegram bot on production!"

Save it in a file with a `.java` extension (e.g., `HelloWorld.java`).\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt.\n3. Compile the Java file using the command: `javac HelloWorld.java`.\n4.
